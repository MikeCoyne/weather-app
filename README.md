# weather-app
This is the Weather App. The user can search for a 5 day weather forecast for any city. It provides temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index for the current day and the next 4 days as well. Users are supposed to have an option for saving the weather forecast for a city, which should be stored in local storage, however this function is not working yet.
